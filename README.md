# Let’s Build: With Ruby on Rails – Marketplace App with Stripe Connect

_This repo is a ficticious marketplace app meant to teach you the basics of using Stripe Connect combined with Ruby on Rails to build your own marketplace. It's free to reference/use but far from feature complete._

Welcome to another installment of my Let’s Build: With Ruby on Rails series. This series focuses on building a marketplace application using Stripe Connect. Users can sign up, purchase, and sell their own goods and services while the application takes a percentage of each transaction.

### Back My Idea

Our fictitious marketplace app is called Back My Idea. Back my Idea is an app similar to GoFundMe and Kickstarter where users can crowdsource/fund their way to building their next big idea. Entrepreneurs/Designers/Developers can pitch their concept of an app and ask for donations to help fund their process of building it.
